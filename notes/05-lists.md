# Chapter 4: Lists in Python

This chapter focuses on how to create, manipulate, and iterate through lists â€” one of Pythonâ€™s most powerful and flexible data types.

## ðŸ§  What Are Lists?

- A **list** is an ordered, mutable collection of items.
- Lists can store **multiple values** (numbers, strings, or even other lists).
- Lists are created using **square brackets `[ ]`**.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [42, "hello", True, 3.14]
