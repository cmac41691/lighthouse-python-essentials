### 🕹️ Word Game Project (Mad Libs + Hangman)

**Status:** In Progress (Step 4 Complete)  
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Course:** Lighthouse Labs — Python Essentials  

#### 🎯 Overview
The Word Game project merges two mini-games: **Mad Libs** and **Hangman**.  
Players can choose which game to play from a menu and replay as many times as they like.

#### ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Modular imports from `mad_libs.py` and `hangman.py`
- Main `play_games()` function that displays menu options
- Interactive input using `if / elif / else` logic
- `while True` loop for replaying until user exits
- Clean user feedback and exit prompts

#### 💡 Next Steps
- Add polish and fine-tune end-of-game messages
- Explore optional game scoring or tracking systems
- Finalize and submit for Lighthouse Labs review

## Dev Reflection
> Today I learned the value of tracking state variables in modular programs.  
> Managing loops, imports, and user input together made me realize how game logic mirrors real-world app flow.
