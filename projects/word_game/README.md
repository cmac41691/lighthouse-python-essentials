# 🕹️ Hangman — Python Mini Game

**Project Type:** Lighthouse Labs Milestone  
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-18  
**Status:** ✅ Version 1.0 — Fully Functional  

---

## 🎯 Overview
This project is a simplified **Hangman** game built entirely in Python.  
The player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time before running out of attempts.  
It demonstrates logic control, loops, conditionals, and string manipulation — all core Python concepts.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Randomly selects a secret word from a list  
- Tracks user guesses and remaining attempts  
- Prevents duplicate guesses (no double penalty)  
- Reveals letters in real-time as they’re guessed  
- Ends with a clear win/loss message and final word reveal  

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- `while` loops and iteration  
- `if / else` conditional logic  
- String methods (`lower()`, `strip()`, `join()`)  
- List indexing and updates  
- User input validation  
- Python set usage for storing guesses

## 🧩 Example Output
-- Current State ---
Word so far: _ _ _ _ _ _
Attempts left: 6
Tried: -

Please put in a letter: o
Nice job on the right letter!
Word so far: _ o _ _ o _
Attempts left: 6
Tried: o

## 🪜 Next Steps
- Add difficulty levels (easy / normal / hard)
- Include ASCII art for each hangman stage
- Integrate into `word_game.py` main menu alongside *Mad Libs*
