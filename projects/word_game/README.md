### üïπÔ∏è Word Game ‚Äî Current Build Summary (Milestone: Step 2‚Äì3 Complete)

This version introduces a functional **main menu system** that connects both mini-games ‚Äî *Mad Libs* and *Hangman* ‚Äî into one modular program.

#### Features Added
- Implemented `play_games()` function as the project‚Äôs main entry point.  
- Added a **looping menu** allowing players to:
  - Play *Mad Libs*  
  - Play *Hangman*  
  - Exit the program gracefully.  
- Integrated module imports:
  - `from mad_libs import start_mad_libs`  
  - `from hangman import start_hangman`  
- Added input validation for smoother user experience.  
- Structured code for future expansion (Step 4‚Äì6).

#### Developer Notes
This milestone marks a major progression in combining separate Python scripts into a cohesive multi-module program.  
The project now demonstrates:
- Function encapsulation (`def play_games()`)  
- Input handling with loops  
- Basic modular architecture across files  

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement game triggers to launch each mode fully.  
- [ ] Add replay and end-game messages per mode.  
- [ ] Begin integrating Step 4‚Äì6 (state updates and refinements).
