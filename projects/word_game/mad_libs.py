# Project: Mad Libs
# ------------------
# Goal: Build a simple Mad Libs generator that asks the user for words 
# and fills them into a story template.

# Step 1: Create a story template with blanks
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python f-string user input"
# Example: "Just as I arrived at {place}, I realized I had forgotten my {object}."

# Step 2: Ask the user for inputs
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python input string"
# - Ask for a place
# - Ask for an object
# - (add more as you like)

# Step 3: Insert user inputs into the story
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python f-string format variables"
# - Replace placeholders with user input

# Step 4: Print the completed story
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python print formatted string"
