# Project: Hangman (simplified)
# ------------------
# Goal: Build a word guessing game where the user guesses letters 
# until they win or run out of attempts.

# Step 1: Choose a secret word
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python random choice from list"
# Example: words = ["python", "lighthouse", "code"]

# Step 2: Initialize game state
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python underscores for word guessing"
# - Create underscores for each letter
# - Track guesses
# - Set max attempts (e.g., 6)

# Step 3: Ask user for a guess
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python input single character"
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python validate input length"
# - Make sure itâ€™s a single letter

# Step 4: Check guess
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python if char in string"
# - If correct, replace underscore
# - If wrong, subtract attempt

# Step 5: Print current state
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python join list into string"
# - Show progress (_ a _ _)
# - Show remaining attempts

# Step 6: End game conditions
# ðŸ‘‰ Google: "python while loop break conditions"
# - Win if all letters guessed
# - Lose if attempts run out
