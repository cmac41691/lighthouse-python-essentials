# Trip Budget Calculator (prototype)

# Step 1: Collect user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Step 2: Declare variables (structure ideas)
flight = {}   # maybe store airline + cost
hotel = {}    # maybe store nights + cost
food = {}     # maybe store meals + cost
tax_rate = 0.14  # placeholder

# Step 3: Do calculations
subtotal = 0   # will hold total of flight + hotel + food
# subtotal = flight_cost + hotel_cost + food_cost
# total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax_rate)

# Step 4: Print result
# print(f"Hello {name}, your trip will cost ${total:.2f}")
