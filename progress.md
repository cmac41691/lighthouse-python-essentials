## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections
**Date**: 2025-09-07

**This week / day**: Started Chapter 2 (Strings). Created prototype files for 
introduction to strings, multi-line strings, string operations, and string replacement exercise.

**Progress**: Set up new `chapter2/` folder under `projects/` and added empty Python 
files as placeholders. Ready to begin practicing with string basics and manipulations.

**Challenges**: None so far â€” just focusing on organizing files and keeping the 
workflow consistent.

**Next step**: Begin filling in code examples for each file (starting with 
`introduction_to_strings.py`) and test them in the terminal.

 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
