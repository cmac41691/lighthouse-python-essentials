# 📈 Python Essentials Progress Log

This document tracks my journey through Lighthouse Labs’ **Programming Essentials with Python** course.  
Each section summarizes what I learned, what I practiced, and reflections on my growth as a self-taught developer.

---

## ✔ Completed Lesson 6 — Functions & Reuse
**Skills Learned**
- Defining and calling functions  
- Parameters, arguments, return values, and scope  
- Writing modular, reusable code  
- Structuring logic with pseudocode first  
- Using docstrings for clarity and maintainability  
- Testing functions individually  
- Strengthening backend-style reasoning  

**Reflection**  
Lesson 6 dramatically improved how I approach problems.  
Pseudocode has become the backbone of my workflow — helping me think clearly and translate logic into Pythonic code with confidence.

---

## ✔ Completed Lesson 5 — Loops & Repetition  
**Exercises Completed**
- Loop patterns  
- List transformations  
- Counting algorithms  
- String iteration and character analysis  
- Reverse operations, vowel extraction, frequency counting  

**Reflection**  
This chapter sharpened my logical reasoning.  
Loop patterns started to feel natural — something that directly supported my growth when building larger, multi-file programs.

# 🧩 Phase 5 — Persistent Save + Reset System
**What Was Added**
- JSON persistence layer (`storage.py`)  
- Auto-creation of save file when missing  
- Safe reset system with user confirmation  
- First real implementation of stateful program behavior  

**Reflection**  
This was my first taste of *stateful programming*.  
Seeing data persist across sessions felt like a breakthrough — moving beyond isolated scripts into real application design.

---

# 🧩 Phase 6 — Navigator, Pause System, and Refactor (Completed)
**Features Added**
- New `navigator.py` module for clean menu handling  
- Single, modular interface for game selection  
- New `pause()` function for smoother UX  
- Storage logic improved and edge cases fixed  
- Main loop in `word_game.py` fully refactored  

**Reflection**  
Phase 6 transformed the Word Game Hub into a *proper modular application*.  
Everything clicked — menus, persistence, and structure now work like a real backend project with multiple components.

# 💭 Final Thoughts
Each chapter built my skills step by step — from loops, to functions, to designing a multi-file program with real persistence.  
This repo shows not only **what** I learned, but **how I learned**:

- Pseudocode first  
- Logical breakdown  
- Clean, testable code  
- Incremental improvements  
- Meaningful commits  

### Next Steps
- Begin **Python Interlude Repo**  
- Prepare for **Meta Backend Developer** program  
- Continue strengthening backend fundamentals  

> *I think in pseudocode, build with intent, and refine through practice.*
