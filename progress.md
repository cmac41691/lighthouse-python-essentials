## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections  

**Date**: 2025-09-03  

**This week / day**: Refactored Step 2 to replace the placeholder `mock_dict` with the real `inns` dataset. Kept my loop and comparison logic intact but upgraded it to work with actual hotel names and costs.  

**Progress**: Program now prints which hotels are affordable using the real list of dictionaries. Added `affordable_hotels` as a foundation for carrying forward hotel data into Step 3. Flight validation and hotel budget validation loops remain in place.  

**Challenges**: Making sure I translated my prototype logic into real data without breaking the barebones flow. Had to check how indices vs. dictionaries worked when storing results.  

**Next step**: For Friday, start Step 4 â€” add a chosen hotelâ€™s cost into the subtotal, calculate total with tax, and print a clean summary for the user.  



## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
