# 📈 Python Essentials Progress Log

This file documents my progress through the **Programming Essentials with Python** course by Lighthouse Labs. Each section includes what I learned, notes, and reflection on what I found most useful.

### ✅ 2025-11-08 — Phase 2: Trivia Integration Complete

**Highlights**
- Implemented **`trivia.py`** as a standalone modular game.
- Added `start_trivia()` function with:
  - Dynamic question/answer system.
  - Input validation and replay logic.
  - Score tracking and end-of-game summary.
- Integrated Trivia into the main hub (`word_game.py`) as option **3**.
- Verified full runtime stability — all three games (Mad Libs, Hangman, Trivia) function independently and loop back correctly.
- Tested imports and menu flow in VS Code terminal — no crashes or invalid references.

**Reflection**
> Today marks a big shift from single-script logic to a **true modular structure**.  
> The hub now behaves like a controller, and each mini-game is an independent module — easy to scale, debug, or expand in future phases.

**Next Goals (Phase 3 – Planned)**
- Add persistent scoring (save scores to JSON or text file).
- Expand Trivia with external question packs.
- Introduce ASCII art or styled text for the main menu.
- Begin lightweight testing scripts for each module.


### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Learned how to properly structure a **loop for replaying games**.
- Gained better understanding of **module imports and function calls**.
- Strengthened grasp on **loop control (`break`, `continue`)** and user input handling.
- Progress toward mastering **multi-module project design** in Python.

### 🔜 Next Step:
- Begin refining **Step 5** (game state updates or polish).
- Write pseudocode to define how to handle any future replay/score tracking logic.

Optional polish: color output or difficulty selector (easy/medium/hard)

💭 I think in pseudocode, build with intent, and refine through practice.  
AI helps me reason faster, not skip the work.  
Each project documents real self-taught progress.
