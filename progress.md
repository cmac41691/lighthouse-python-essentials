## Progress Update â€” 2025-10-26

### âœ… Completed:
- Finished **Step 4** of the Word Game project (Lighthouse Python Essentials).
- Implemented **replay loop logic** using `while True`.
- Added **player choice input**, `if/elif/else` handling, and `break` for exit flow.
- Integrated **Mad Libs** and **Hangman** modules using import statements.
- Fixed Python syntax issues (`.strip()` vs `.trim()`) and placement of `break` within loop.
- Tested the replay system â€” confirmed functional and user-friendly.

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:
- Learned how to properly structure a **loop for replaying games**.
- Gained better understanding of **module imports and function calls**.
- Strengthened grasp on **loop control (`break`, `continue`)** and user input handling.
- Progress toward mastering **multi-module project design** in Python.

### ðŸ”œ Next Step:
- Begin refining **Step 5** (game state updates or polish).
- Write pseudocode to define how to handle any future replay/score tracking logic.

Optional polish: color output or difficulty selector (easy/medium/hard)
