## ðŸ§  Reflections
## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections
- **Date**: 2025-08-29  
- **This week / day**: Even though Thursday started lighter, I put in extra work Thursday + Friday to keep pace.  
- **Progress**: Steps 1â€“2 now in place (flight validation + hotels with budget filter).  
- **Challenges**: Need to refine the `for` loop logic for comparing hotel costs with available resources.  
- **Next step**: Tackle Step 3 on Saturday (subtotal + tax calculation).


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
