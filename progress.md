## Progress Log â€” October 23, 2025

- Completed Step 2 and Step 3 of the Word Game project.
- Implemented `play_games()` function to handle menu input and trigger Mad Libs or Hangman modules.
- Added replay logic using a while loop.
- Tested interaction flow successfully â€” menu choices, exit condition, and modular structure all work.
- Next: finalize Step 4â€“6 to connect both mini-games into one full interactive program.

ðŸ’¡ Reflection:
This session was a huge step forward in understanding modular programming â€” combining functions and imports across files. The menu logic feels intuitive now, and structure looks clean. Confidence is growing fast!

## Next Steps:

Begin planning Mad Libs â†’ Hangman integration into word_game.py.

Optional polish: color output or difficulty selector (easy/medium/hard)
