## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections
**Date**: 2025-09-08

**This week / day**: Expanded Chapter 2 work by filling in starter code for 
all string lesson files and created new notes file `03-strings.md`.

**Progress**: Successfully tested examples for introduction, multi-line strings, 
operations (indexing, slicing, case changes), and replacement. Notes now include 
concepts, examples, and expected outputs.

**Challenges**: Needed to make sure notes matched the code outputs 
to avoid confusion later. Resolved by running all files and documenting results.

**Next step**: Continue practicing with the Chapter 2 exercises and update notes 
with any new insights as I progress.

 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
