### (2025-10-19)
- Completed Step 1 of Word Game project.
- Implemented main menu with input validation and error handling.
- Tested all options; next step is linking Hangman and Mad Libs functions.
 


Testing:

- Verified multiple rounds â€” correct letters reveal properly.
- Wrong guesses decrement attempts accurately.
- Game ends cleanly with correct or failure state.
- No input or crash errors during runtime.

## Next Steps:

Begin planning Mad Libs â†’ Hangman integration into word_game.py.

Optional polish: color output or difficulty selector (easy/medium/hard)
