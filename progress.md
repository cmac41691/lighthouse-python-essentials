## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections

**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Progress**: Completed Steps 1â€“4 of the Trip Budget prototype. Added working input validation for flight and hotel, included food cost, calculated subtotal/tax, and generated a clean trip summary output.  
**Challenges**: Debugging variable references (hotel_price vs. affordable hotel loop) and ensuring totals included all parts correctly. Fixed issues with undefined variables by restructuring logic.  
**Next step**: Polish the project (better user experience, maybe handle multiple hotel picks) and start preparing for the next Lighthouse Labs lesson/chapter.
 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
