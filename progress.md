## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections
## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections  

**Date**: 2025-08-31  

**This week / day**: Pushed forward on Steps 1â€“2 by adding flight validation and a hotel budget filter, then moved into Step 3 by setting up food cost and subtotal placeholders. Practiced building out logic piece by piece while keeping things clear and simple.  

**Progress**: Prototype now accepts flight input, validates hotel budget against available options, and sets up subtotal/tax placeholders. Added food cost as float input to prepare for full subtotal calculations.  

**Challenges**: Need to tighten subtotal logic so it includes hotel + food cost cleanly. Also figuring out how to connect dictionary values (inn cost) with user resources without making it too advanced.  

**Next step**: Work on Step 3 fully (subtotal + tax calculation). Focus on keeping it beginner-friendly: combine flight, hotel, and food costs into subtotal, then add tax.  



## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
