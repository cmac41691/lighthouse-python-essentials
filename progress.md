**Date**: 2025-09-16  

**This week / day**: Began Chapter 3 by creating `04-numbers.md` and adding detailed notes from the "Introduction to Numbers" lesson.  

**Progress**:  
- Learned how numbers differ from strings (cannot use `len()` or string concatenation).  
- Practiced basic operations: `2 + 2` vs `"2" + "2"`.  
- Understood difference between `int` and `float`.  
- Explored type conversion using `float()` and `int()` (decimal truncation).  

**Challenges**: Needed to carefully track where errors came from when mixing strings and numbers.  

**Next step**: Move on to the "Math in Python" lesson and expand notes in `04-numbers.md`.  


 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
