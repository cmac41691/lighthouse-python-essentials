### 2025-09-21  
- Started work on **Exercise: Tax Calculator**.  
- Implemented user input handling using `float(input())`.  
- Added calculation for tax (13%) and total amount.  
- Practiced clear variable naming (`user_amount`, `tax_amount`, `tax_amount_total`).  
- Next: refine printing with f-strings and improve user experience.  


 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
