## ðŸŒ¸ Reflections
**Date**: 2025-09-06  

**This week / day**: Finished Step 4 (Trip Summary printing). Successfully tested in terminal, showing correct subtotal, tax, and total outputs.  

**Progress**: Completed prototype Steps 1â€“4 (flight validation, hotel budget filter, food cost input, and full trip summary with totals). Chapter 1 now considered done.  

**Challenges**: Had to debug subtotal/total logic and adjust variable naming for consistency. Worked through input validation and printing formatting issues.  

**Next step**: Move into Chapter 2 â€“ start applying what I learned to new exercises/projects.  

 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
