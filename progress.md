**Date**: 2025-09-14  
**This week / day**: Scaffolded Chapter 3 (Numbers) by creating a new directory and starter files.  
**Progress**: Organized four files to match the upcoming lessons and exercises. Repo structure remains clean and consistent.  
**Challenges**: Decided to keep everything on the `main` branch for simplicity rather than branching.  
**Next step**: Begin working through "Introduction to Numbers" and update notes in `04-numbers.md`.  



 


## ðŸ›  Future Plans
- Convert project into a standalone app or script
- Explore intermediate Python or data projects
