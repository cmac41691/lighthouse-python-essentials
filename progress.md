### 🗓 Progress Update — 2025-11-02
- Implemented ValueError exception handling to validate menu input.
- Added player score system with cumulative session tracking.
- Integrated replay loop with improved user experience and input validation.
- Tested edge cases for input stability and confirmed loop functionality.
- Word Game Phase 1 stable — ready for further enhancements.


### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Learned how to properly structure a **loop for replaying games**.
- Gained better understanding of **module imports and function calls**.
- Strengthened grasp on **loop control (`break`, `continue`)** and user input handling.
- Progress toward mastering **multi-module project design** in Python.

### 🔜 Next Step:
- Begin refining **Step 5** (game state updates or polish).
- Write pseudocode to define how to handle any future replay/score tracking logic.

Optional polish: color output or difficulty selector (easy/medium/hard)

💭 I think in pseudocode, build with intent, and refine through practice.  
AI helps me reason faster, not skip the work.  
Each project documents real self-taught progress.
