**This week / day**: Completed the Chapter 2 exercise on String Replacement. 
Copied the provided lyrics, applied the `.replace()` method to fix incorrect words, 
and confirmed the corrected version printed in the terminal.

**Progress**: Learned how to use `.replace(old, new)` to transform text. 
Successfully chained multiple replacements to clean up the broken lyrics. 
Both the original and fixed versions were displayed for clarity.

**Challenges**: Needed to carefully check each incorrect word before replacing 
to avoid missing one. Realized how important precision is when manipulating strings.

**Next step**: Move forward to the next section of Chapter 2 while continuing 
to update notes with examples and outputs.
